<p>Iâ€™m from Saudi Arabia and I love MIU. I speak English and Arabic and I am currently learning Spanish. I have attended many social media conferences in order to stay up to date with what is going on in the digital world.I am a peer mentor at school and there are three personal strengths that will help me as a peer mentor at school are my good-willed nature, my positive attitude and my view towards people. In order to be able to help other people, a person has to have a good nature. I feel that I want the best for everyone and I treat everyone equal. There is no difference between the way that I treat my mother and a stranger. I have to love and respect all of my fellow human beings. The second thing that will be strength for me is my positive look on life. I always try to find the good things in life and I always try to make other people see the good things in life. By doing this, I create a domino effect of positivity in the society. Lastly, I have a view that everyone has the potential to be great in the society. When I explain to people that they have hidden potential, it makes them happy and wants to do better in life.</p>
